# Backend

## Troubleshooting
If you are getting a 404, make sure the allow_origins host is the correct number as the frontend local host number.

## Running
Navigate to the backend/src/api folder. 
Run 'uvicorn recommender_lightfm_api:app --reload'

Run the frontend in a different terminal and watch the magic happen
